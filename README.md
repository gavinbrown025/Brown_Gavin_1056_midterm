# Beer Marketing Website

## This is the static version of our site 
I wanted to go with a bit more of a complex floating navigation bar to give the initial presentation some depth.
We will have mostly promotional content on the site with the goal of sales. So this is setup to put that promotional content front and center. The page is mostly placeholder content. Content with the mashing of Tucks and Red Stripe to follow.

## Created With HTML & CSS
Practiced some different animations
